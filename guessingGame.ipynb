    "**Mechanism Of the Game:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "The game generates a number between 1 and 100, and will give a random clue to start off.  The player starts with a score of 20, losing a point for each incorrect guess.  After the first 2 guesses, the game will try to make your life easier by telling you if you're getting warmer or colder than your immediately preceding guess.  After 7 incorrect guesses, the game is programmed to feel bad for you and give you another random clue from the remaining clue pool.  "
